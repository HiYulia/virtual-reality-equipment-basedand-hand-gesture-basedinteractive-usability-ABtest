### Divided 24 subjects into two groups based on background information and pre-test performance

### pre-test performance
prepare related documents and tools
informed consent form：make sure subjects' privacy
Anfimov table: Is a method of testing attentional stability
test workflow:
Fill in the basic information
pretest Fatigue test:Anfimov table
game test: 
Mind and Team Fortress
menu demos, keyboard demos,
posttest Fatigue test:Anfimov table
To make sure there is no significent different between two group, we use f-TEST(WE DO NOT TO postpone THE conclusion to population, just to make sure these two samples a evenly), and we passed that test since the p value here is bigger than 0.05.


### compared different interactive methods applied in VR games through A/B test

1. Tell the test object's purpose, process, time, and precautions, and let the testee fill in the informed consent form.
2. Record the pre-investigation information of the testee.
3. Provide test tasks to the testee.
4. Observe the feedback (expressions, questions, etc.) whether it is wrong, and record.
5. After the end of a mission, interview the test and ask if you understand the task, the cause of the error, and the plan at the time, and record it.
6. Answer the questions of the person being tested.

The Emotiv helmet is required to be tested, and the brain wave state of the test subject is tested for 20 seconds.

### Theoretical basis
Motion sickness due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films.

Early related research shows that 80% of people who experience virtual reality for the first time will experience different degrees of dizziness within 20 minutes. With the improvement of the virtual reality system in the past two years, this number will decline, but the virtual reality is motionless. The disease is still very common.

The alpha brain wave is the brainwave when people relax and contemplate

The beta brain wave is a conscious brain wave that runs at a frequency of 12 to 25 cycles per second. When people are awake, specially, the state of alertness, or the state of mind, when analyzing, analyzing, speaking, and acting positively, sends this brainwave.

The θ brain wave is the brain wave that people emit when they are immersed in fantasy or just falling asleep.

The δ brain wave is the brain wave that people emit when they sleep without dreams. 


### analyzed experimental data including task errors, times and choices of users
#### hypothetical test:

To make sure there is no significent different between two group, we use f-TEST(WE DO NOT TO postpone THE conclusion to population, just to make sure these two samples a evenly), and we passed that test since the p value here is bigger than 0.05.
Since the whole process needs to communicate through language, and in the case of a long task chain, the tester will tell the next step what to do, which will interfere with the measured to some extent.

#### Communication validity
Throughout the test, almost all of the tests were carried out with an Oculus helmet. Therefore, this kind of communication will affect the test results to some extent.

The θ wave changes are relatively small, the α wave decreases, and the β wave increases. It is comprehensively shown that people's burden pressure is getting bigger and the mood is not as easy and pleasant as before the test.

### provided recommendations of creating VR games based on results of tests

1. when users need to take gestures that are not commonly used to complete some tasks, it is best to be able to explain by video, and some simple operation can be prompted by voice.
2. Use the voice prompt reasonablely, otherwise user will be interrupted
3. Try to avoid unusual operations in gesture settings.
4. For games with lots of features, it requires multiple interfaces. In this case, if the interface changes with gestures, it is very easy to cause misuse. I suggest set the interface be a fixed and does not change as the user gestures move, which reduces a lot of mistakens and improves the system Stability.
5. The simpler way to develop a user's habits is based on the user's learning process, which requires a presentation or prompt before the user uses the software. This will play an important role in preventing users from making mistakes.
6. In the case of different destination operations (especially when the two operations are connected) corresponding to the same gesture, it is recommended to introduce a new element as confirmation option between these two operations, which may be a gesture distinguished from the former, or a voice confirmation.
7.provided multiple paths and it can greatly reduce the user's learning pressure.
8. It is not recommended that the difference between the two gestures for different functions is relatively small since It is easy to be confused
9. If the gesture operations are used to perform complex operations in the same system, it is necessary to clearly define the implementation of various functions, and try to avoid mutual interference and cause confusion.
10. put something with useful information in front of the user, not decorations.
11. Try to take natural operation methods and reduce the user's physical load.
